# Easy testable node app 

This is a simple node-app with the idea of a appointments system with unit tests.

the idea is to have an app that makes unit tests and is completely independent
without databases.

in this app i used only TypeScript and Vitest as my test framework and used Solid's Dependency Inversion Principle
