# Easy testable node app 

This is a simple node-app that makes appointments and tests them.

the idea is to have an app that makes unit tests and is completely independent
without databases and queries.

in this app i used only TypeScript, Vitest as my test framework and used Solid's Dependency Inversion Principle
